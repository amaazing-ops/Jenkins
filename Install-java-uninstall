Install Java:
=============
sudo apt install default-jre

Uninstall Java:
===============
dpkg -l | grep 21

sudo apt-get purge openjdk-21*

sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean

java -version

Alternative: 
============
Keep the Install versions and switch the version.
A Quick Tip: "The Alternative"
If your goal was just to stop Jenkins from using Java 21 and use Java 17 instead, you don't necessarily have to delete 21.
You can just tell Ubuntu which one to use as the default:
sudo update-alternatives --config java

This will give you a list of installed versions. You just type the number of the version you want to be the "boss."
