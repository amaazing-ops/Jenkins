To skip tests, add the -DskipTests flag:
========================================
mvn clean install -DskipTests

** Run this command to view the plain-text reports:
=====================
cat /root/ishaa/target/surefire-reports/*.txt

If you prefer to see the test failures directly in your terminal output without opening the report files, you can tell Maven to print them to the console.
Run your Maven command again with this flag added:
   mvn test -Dsurefire.useFile=false
